Weather API Library &amp; Command-line tool

There are a few APIs for NOAA already out there for other languages, but I couldn't find one for OCaml. So as a project to start picking up OCaml again and becoming more well versed I decided to do this. For now I am limiting to just parsing the current weather information + precipitation forecast as I am interested in snowfall. As time goes on I'll slowly add more parsing methods. I'm also going to integrate with Weatherunderground API as it has JSON support. Traversing the JSON in OCaml might be easier. If anyone has any comments and would like to contribute feel free.
