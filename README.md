NOAA Weather API Library &amp; Command-line tool

There are a few APIs for NOAA already out there for other languages, but I couldn't find one for OCaml. So as a project to start picking up OCaml again and becoming more well versed I decided to do this. For now I am limiting to just parsing the current weather information + precipitation forecast as I am interested in snowfall. As time goes on I'll slowly add more parsing methods. Essentially it boils down to traversing the XML retrieved from NOAA. If anyone has any comments and would like to contribute feel free.
